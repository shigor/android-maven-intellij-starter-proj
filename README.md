# Building Android applications with Maven and IntelliJ

A starter project for Android based on Maven for IntelliJ IDEA.

I picked the code from this [great blog post by Christian Bauer](http://4thline.org/articles/Building%20Android%20applications%20with%20Maven%20and%20IntelliJ.html) describing the process to build an Android app with Maven and IntelliJ IDEA. The post is a bit outdated now but the project structure is very clean to start from scratch.

Follow the steps described in the blog post, it's working pretty well.
